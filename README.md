### Hi! ðŸ‘‹

Thank you for visiting my GitHub Profile! Here is some info about me!

#### Work ðŸ”­

Iâ€™m currently working as a Full Stack Engineer remotely at [Idana by Tomes](https://idana.com/) in Germany. I'm working with nodeJs, TypeScript, Vue and more.

Due to my studies, I work only part-time at the moment. Balancing work and education would be otherwise very hard, if not impossible.

#### Education ðŸŒ±

Iâ€™m currently a Computer Science student at the Paris Lodron University in Salzburg, Austria.
Balancing education and work is not an easy task, but I am managing it succesfully.

I'm especially interested in Compilers and Symbolic Execution.

#### Interests ðŸ¤”

I'm very interested in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language, and am actively seeking opportunities to contribute to projects written in Rust!

Right now, I'm working with my good friend and colleague [@mhatzl](https://github.com/mhatzl) on a new markup language with the goal to have a modern alternative to LaTeX. The implementation of the compiler is being written in Rust.
