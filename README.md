### Hi! 👋

Thank you for visiting my GitHub Profile!

#### Work 🔭

I’m currently working as a Embedded Software Engineer at [Commend](https://www.commend.com/) in Austria where I have the opportunity to 
work on amazing projects in Rust.

#### Education 🌱

I graduated my Bachelor degree in Computer Science at the Computer Science department of the Paris Lodron University in Salzburg, Austria. 
My bachelor thesis "Exploring Reasoning Performance of RISC-V Software Models in BTOR2" can be found in the repository of the 
[selfie project](https://github.com/cksystemsteaching/selfie/blob/main/theses/bachelor_thesis_fejzic.pdf). The thesis was awarded by the 
company [teampool](https://www.teampool.com/) as one of the three best bachelor theses of our department in the academic year 2023/24. 

#### Interests 🤔

My special interest is the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language. Currently working with [@mhatzl](https://github.com/mhatzl) 
on a new markup language with the goal to have a modern alternative to LaTeX. The implementation of the compiler is being written in Rust.
Some other projects I wrote are [mathemascii](https://github.com/nfejzic/mathemascii), [alemat](https://github.com/nfejzic/alemat) 
and [ribbon](https://github.com/nfejzic/ribbon).
