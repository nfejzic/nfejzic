### Hi! ðŸ‘‹

Thank you for visiting my GitHub Profile! Here is some info about me!

#### Work ðŸ”­

Iâ€™m currently working as a Frontend Developer in Prien am Chiemsee, Germany. I'm mainly working with HTML, CSS and Javascript, as well as Vue with Typescript.
I coded many websites and progressive web apps (PWAs). Some of the projects are simple static websites, and some use Content Management Systems 
like Contao and Wordpress. Making websites fancy using various animations is my specialty!

Due to my studies, I work only part-time at the moment. Balancing work and education would be otherwise very hard, if not impossible. 

#### Education ðŸŒ±

Iâ€™m currently a Computer Science student at the Paris Lodron University in Salzburg, Austria. 
Balancing education and work is not an easy task, but I am managing it succesfully.

I'm especially interested in Compilers and Symbolic Execution.

#### Interests ðŸ¤”

I'm very interested in Rust programming language, and am actively seeking opportunities to contribute to projects written in Rust!

**Note:** I'm currently open for job offers as a Rust programmer.
